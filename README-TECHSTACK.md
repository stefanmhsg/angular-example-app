# Yarn

Yarn is a fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool for JavaScript projects, much like how Maven and Gradle are for Java projects. It was created by Facebook in response to some of the shortcomings of npm (Node Package Manager) at the time, such as performance and security issues. Yarn provides a better experience in terms of faster dependency installations, more reliable installations through lock files (**yarn.lock**), and improved security features.

While Maven and Gradle are used primarily in the Java ecosystem for managing project dependencies, building projects, and more, Yarn serves a similar purpose in the JavaScript and Node.js ecosystems. It manages libraries and packages your project depends on, resolves their versions, and ensures consistency across environments.

### What does **npm install --global yarn** do?

The command **npm install --global yarn** uses npm (Node Package Manager) to install Yarn globally on your system. Installing a package globally means that you can run it from any directory in your terminal or command prompt, not just from the directory where your project is located. This is useful for command-line tools like Yarn that you might want to run from anywhere.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

*   **npm install**: This is the npm command to download and install a package.

*   **\--global** or **\-g**: This flag tek### What is Yarn?

Here's a breakdown of the command:

*   **npm install**: This is the npm command to download and install a package.
    
*   **\--global** or **\-g**: This flag tells npm to install the package globally on your system rather than in the local **node\_modules** folder of a specific project.
    
*   **yarn**: This is the name of the package you're installing, which in this case is Yarn itself.
    

### From which directory should you run it?

Since you're installing Yarn globally, it doesn't matter which directory you're in when you run **npm install --global yarn**. The installation is not specific to any project and will be available system-wide. Therefore, you do not need to be in the directory of the cloned project to run this command. You can run it from any directory.

After installing Yarn globally, you can then navigate to your project's directory (the one you cloned) and use Yarn to install the project dependencies. Typically, you'd do this by running **yarn install** in the project's root directory, where the **package.json** file is located. This command reads the **package.json** (and **yarn.lock** if present) to install the required packages for your project.

### Summary

Yarn is a powerful tool for managing dependencies in JavaScript projects, offering benefits over npm in certain areas, especially in terms of performance and consistency. By installing it globally with **npm install --global yarn**, you make it accessible from any directory on your system, facilitating its use across all your JavaScript projects. After installation, you can proceed to use Yarn for dependency management within your specific project by running yarn commands in the project's root directory.

Node Package Manager
--------------------

**npm**, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for JavaScript's runtime environment Node.js. It serves as a command-line utility for interacting with a repository of open-source projects and packages in the JavaScript ecosystem. **npm** is integral for modern web development, allowing developers to share and consume packages, manage dependencies in their projects, and access a vast registry of JavaScript libraries and applications.

### Key Features and Functions of npm:

*   **Package Management:** npm allows developers to install, update, and manage packages (libraries and tools) required for their projects. Each package and version is registered in the **npm** registry, making it accessible for installation.
    
*   **Dependency Management:** It handles project dependencies through the **package.json** file, where project-specific settings and dependent packages are defined. npm installs dependencies into the **node\_modules** directory of a project, ensuring that scripts have access to the packages they need.
    
*   **Version Control:** npm supports semantic versioning (semver) for packages, enabling developers to specify and manage versions of the packages they use, including major, minor, and patch version updates.
    
*   **Scripts Execution:** Developers can define and run scripts from the **package.json** file for common tasks like starting a server, building the project, or running tests. This simplifies project setup and deployment processes.
    
*   **Publishing Packages:** npm not only allows for the consumption of packages but also for the publication of your own packages to the npm registry, making them available for other developers worldwide.
    
*   **Package Discovery:** The npm registry and website offer a searchable database of packages, making it easy for developers to find and select libraries that suit their project needs.
    

### npm vs. Yarn

While **npm** and Yarn are both JavaScript package managers and share similar functionalities, there are differences in performance, security, and certain features:

*   **Performance:** Yarn introduced improvements in package installation speed and reliability compared to npm, especially in versions of npm before 5.0. However, npm has since made significant improvements in performance and security, narrowing the gap between the two tools.
    
*   **Lock Files:** Both tools use lock files to ensure that the same versions of packages are installed across different environments. npm uses **package-lock.json**, while Yarn uses **yarn.lock**.
    
*   **Workspaces:** Yarn initially offered better support for managing multiple packages within a single repository (monorepos) through Workspaces. npm later introduced similar functionalities, enhancing support for monorepos.
    

### Usage

**npm** is bundled with Node.js, so when you install Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your system. It's widely used for managing dependencies in Node.js applications, publishing JavaScript packages, and more.

Despite the emergence of Yarn and its advantages, npm remains a fundamental and widely used tool in the JavaScript and Node.js development communities, with its registry serving as the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world.### What is Yarn?
